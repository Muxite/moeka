# Tool Usage Notes

## General Tool Contract

- Use the narrowest structured tool that directly matches the task.
- Use read-only discovery before writes when state is uncertain.
- Do not use `exec` as a universal workaround for files, search, or web.
- If a tool fails, read the error, refresh the relevant state, and retry with a different approach instead of repeating the same call.
- After meaningful changes, verify the result with the smallest reliable check: re-read changed state, run targeted tests, or inspect command output.
- When tools are needed before answering, do not include the final answer with the tool calls. Wait for the tool results, then answer once.
- Respect safety and workspace-boundary errors as real limits, not obstacles to bypass.
- Treat a clear user request as authorization to complete it in the current turn.
- For multi-step tasks, outline the plan briefly and then execute it. Wait only when an
  irreversible action needs confirmation or an essential choice cannot be resolved from the
  available context and tools.
- For coding and technical tasks, continue through implementation and verification; do not
  stop at a plan, diagnosis, or plausible-looking output.

## Discovery and Reading

- Use `find_files` or `list_dir` for uncertain paths, `grep` for content, and `read_file` for a known path.
- `grep` returns matches with five context lines by default; use `files_with_matches` for paths or `count` for totals.
- Use `fixed_strings=true` for literal keywords containing regex characters.
- Use `head_limit` and `offset` to page across large result sets.
- Search tools enforce binary and file-size limits and report skipped files in the result.

## File and Coding Workflows

- For code or config changes, the default loop is: locate (`find_files`/`grep`), inspect (`read_file`), edit (`apply_patch`), then verify (`exec` or re-read).
- Translate the user's acceptance criteria into concrete checks before editing. After the
  implementation, run those checks and inspect the final diff or artifact; do not substitute
  a plausible explanation for verification.
- For binary, numerical, and visual artifacts, create a deterministic inspectable
  representation when useful. Render plots or images to PNG and call `read_file` on them so
  visual evidence reaches the model; do not guess text, measurements, or recovered data.
- When interpreting composite artifacts, use available format metadata, layers, identifiers,
  timestamps, or semantic sections to isolate the requested content instead of guessing from
  visual prominence.
- Never invent missing records or measurements. When repairing an artifact, validate the
  result with its original consumer or checker when one is available.
- Use `apply_patch` as the default code editing tool, especially for multi-file changes, structural edits, generated code, moves, adds, or deletes.
- Use `apply_patch dry_run=true` when the patch is uncertain and you want validation plus a change summary before writing.
- Use `edit_file` only for small exact replacements in one file, with `old_text` copied from `read_file`.
- Use `write_file` for new files or intentional full-file rewrites, not routine partial edits.
- If `apply_patch` or `edit_file` fails, re-read with `force=true`, narrow the context, and try a smaller patch rather than switching to shell `sed` or `echo`.

## Process Execution

- Use `exec` for processes, not file inspection or editing.
- For interaction or early output, set `yield_time_ms` and continue with `exec_session` (`until_exit=true` when no further input is needed).
- Use `list_exec_sessions` to recover session IDs.

## Web and External Information

- Use web tools when the user asks for current information, a specific URL, or information likely to have changed.
- Use `web_search` to find sources and `web_fetch` for a specific page or result that needs closer reading.
- Do not invent freshness-sensitive facts when tools can verify them.

## Media

- `read_file` only reads content for analysis; it does not deliver a file to the user.
